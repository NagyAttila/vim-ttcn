This package provides keyword completion for TTCN-3.

In insert mode you hit ctrl-x ctrl-k to get suggestions of keywords that could complete the currently typed word.

Note: ctrl-x ctrl-k is the Vim built-in method for dictionary completion; check out vimtip #91 and vimtip #102 for cool stuff and adjustments you can make!
